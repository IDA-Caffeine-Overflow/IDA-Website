#### Domain: Data Analytics Using Machine Learning and AI/Cognitive Solutions Using Deep Learning

A B2C AI model, which can tackle large volumes of information during calamities, assist the relief committee and prioritize the information accurately, reducing the response time and damages. 

Enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption based priority relief routing should be implemented in India along with the option to pre-empt ongoing services, if needed in order to ensure efficacy.
